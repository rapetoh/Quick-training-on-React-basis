<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->



Now we are launching our react app with npm packages.
Then there are some basics commands that need to know to get started or launch the stuff.

- npm create vite@latest : to create the react app (or other types of app but here it is react we are talking about so, once that command runned, we will choose the react option and choose a name for the folder it will create for our project)
    - Vite is actually a modern build tool that provides a fast and optimized development environment for modern web projects, including React applications. It offers several advantages over traditional build tools like Create React App (CRA)

- npm install : to install all the packages that we need for our project (we execute the command after entering the react app folder )

- npm run dev : to launch the app in development mode

- ## npm run build : to build the app in production mode ##
